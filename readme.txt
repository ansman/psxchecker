PSXChecker version 1.0 by Xager

DESCRIPTION:
PSXChecker let's you test various functions in the psp.

You can test all the buttons (except the systembuttons such as home, volume, etc.), screen
by looking for dead/stuck pixels, back light bleeding, etc and also test the speakers.

USE THIS PROGRAM AT YOUR OWN RISK, it had to be said :)


INSTALL:
To install copy the PSXCHECKER folder to ms0:/PSP/GAME/
Should then have ms0:/PSP/GAME/PSXCHECKER/EBOOT.PBP

ms0 is the letter of your psp. D, E, F, etc

If you'd like to compile your own source you'll need OSLib besides the PSP SDK in your PATH. OSLib 2.10 is preferred.

Recommended CPU speed: default (300 mHz)
